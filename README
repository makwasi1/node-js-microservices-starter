# Node Microservices Starter

This project is a starter for building microservices using Node.js.

## Services

The project includes the following microservices:

- Product Service: Handles all operations related to products. Located in [node-microservices-starter/product-service](node-microservices-starter/product-service).
- User Service: Handles all operations related to users. Located in [node-microservices-starter/user-service](node-microservices-starter/user-service).

Each service has its own Dockerfile for containerization and a `package.json` file defining its dependencies and scripts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to each service directory and install the dependencies using `npm install`
3. Use `docker-compose up` to start all services

## Testing

Currently, no tests are specified for the services. You can add tests in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file in each service.

## Dependencies

Both services use Express.js version 4.18.2 for handling HTTP requests.
